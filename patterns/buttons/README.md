The buttons use the primary colour to draw attention and stand out from the white background. Each button has a specific purpose.

- The regular buttons are for cards, forms and where the background is a light color-neutral
- The light buttons are for neutral backgrounds
- The ghost buttons should be used on cards as well to go for a cleaner look. They can also be used on banners with images as their background
